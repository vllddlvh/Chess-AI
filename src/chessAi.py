'''
    Keep DEPTH <= 4 for AI to run smoothly.

    DEPTH means the fot will looks depth moves ahead and calculate the best possible move based on PIECE-CAPTURE-SCORE AND PIECE-POSITION SCORE :
    DEPTH = 4
'''

WAYS TO IMPROVE AI AND MAKE AI FASTER

1) Create a database for initial ai moves/ book openings
2) AI find possible moves for all the piece after each move, if one piece is moved possible moves for other piece would be same no need to find again
    In this case new possible move would be :
        i) if any piece could move to the starting location of piece moved
        ii) if the piece moved to (x, y) position check if it blocked any piece to move to that location
3) no need to evaluate all the position again and again use zobrus hashing to save good position and depth
4) if [ black moved x, white move a, black moved y, white move b ] is sometime same as: 
      [ black moved y, white move a, black moved x, white move b ]
      [ black moved x, white move b, black moved y, white move a ]
      [ black moved y, white move b, black moved y, white move a ]
5) Teach theories to AI, like some time it is better to capture threat than to move a pawn or take back our piece to previous position rather than attacking
